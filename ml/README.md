Absolutely. But I'd recommend we build it as a **production-quality ML module**, not just a single `train.py` script.

Since this is becoming one of the flagship features of your FX Research Terminal, I'd like to build it the same way a quant team would.

## The roadmap I suggest

We'll build it in **8 stages**, and I'll provide complete code for each stage.

### Stage 1: Project setup

We'll create the ML project structure.

```text

├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   ├── processed/
│   └── exports/
│
├── models/

│   ├── exporter.py
│   ├── inference.py
│   └── utils.py
│
├── train.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

---

### Stage 2: Data loader

We'll write code that reads your exported CSVs and validates:

* missing values
* duplicate dates
* feature names
* target column

---

### Stage 3: Feature pipeline

We'll build a preprocessing pipeline using `scikit-learn` that:

* scales numeric features
* validates feature order
* stores preprocessing parameters for inference

---

### Stage 4: Model training

We'll train:

* Logistic Regression (baseline)
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting

using **time-series validation**, not random train/test splits.

---

### Stage 5: Evaluation

We'll generate:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* ROC AUC
* Confusion Matrix
* Calibration Curve
* Feature Importance

and save them as images and JSON.

---

### Stage 6: Export

We'll export everything the frontend needs into a single `model.json`, for example:

```json
{
  "model": "LogisticRegression",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "trained": "2026-06-27",
  "features": [...],
  "weights": [...],
  "intercept": ...,
  "scaler": {...},
  "metrics": {...}
}
```

---

### Stage 7: Browser inference

The React app will:

* load `model.json`
* compute the latest features
* normalize them
* calculate the probability
* explain the prediction

No Python required in production.

---

### Stage 8: Explainability

We'll add:

* feature contributions
* confidence score
* reliability warnings
* model metadata
* training period
* last trained date

so users understand what the model is doing.

---

## I don't want to give you a single file

Instead, I want to build this as a **mini machine learning framework** that you can extend for years.

By the end, you'll have:

* ✅ a reproducible training pipeline
* ✅ proper evaluation
* ✅ model versioning
* ✅ browser-side inference
* ✅ explainable predictions
* ✅ support for multiple algorithms
* ✅ clean integration with your React terminal

### I estimate the complete implementation will be around:

* **12–15 Python modules**
* **2,500–4,000 lines of well-documented code**
* **Professional-level architecture** suitable for showcasing in your portfolio.

## I recommend we build it chapter by chapter

Rather than overwhelming you with thousands of lines at once, we'll develop it in logical milestones:

1. **Chapter 1:** Project structure and environment.
2. **Chapter 2:** Data loading and validation.
3. **Chapter 3:** Feature engineering and preprocessing.
4. **Chapter 4:** Model training with logistic regression.
5. **Chapter 5:** Model evaluation and visualization.
6. **Chapter 6:** Exporting models for the React frontend.
7. **Chapter 7:** Browser-side inference and integration.
8. **Chapter 8:** Advanced models, explainability, and model management.

This approach will give you a maintainable, professional ML subsystem rather than just a script that trains a model.



# FX Research Terminal ML

This project trains statistical models for the FX Research Terminal.

Training happens entirely offline.

The browser performs only inference.
